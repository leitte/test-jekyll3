abstract: "Advances in technology coupled with the availability of low\u2010cost sensors\
  \ have resulted in the continuous generation of large time series from several sources.\
  \ In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different scales,\
  \ analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include\
  \ constraints and group\u2010by's at multiple temporal hierarchies. Effective visual\
  \ analysis requires these queries to be interactive. However, while existing OLAP\
  \ cube\u2010based structures can support interactive query rates, the exponential\
  \ memory requirement to materialize the data cube is often unsuitable for large\
  \ data sets. Moreover, none of the recent space\u2010efficient cube data structures\
  \ allow for updates. Thus, the cube must be re\u2010computed whenever there is new\
  \ data, making them impractical in a streaming scenario. We propose Time Lattice,\
  \ a memory\u2010efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal\
  \ hierarchy to enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series. Time Lattice\
  \ is a subset of a fully materialized cube and is designed to handle fast updates\
  \ and streaming data. We perform an experimental evaluation which shows that the\
  \ space efficiency of the data structure does not hamper its performance when compared\
  \ to the state of the art. In collaboration with signal processing and acoustics\
  \ research scientists, we use the Time Lattice data structure to design the Noise\
  \ Profiler, a web\u2010based visualization framework that supports the analysis\
  \ of noise from cities. We demonstrate the utility of Noise Profiler through a set\
  \ of case studies."
