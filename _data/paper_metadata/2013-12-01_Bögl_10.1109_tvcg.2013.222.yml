abstract: Model selection in time series analysis is a challenging task for domain
  experts in many application areas such as epidemiology, economy, or environmental
  sciences. The methodology used for this task demands a close combination of human
  judgement and automated computation. However, statistical software tools do not
  adequately support this combination through interactive visual interfaces. We propose
  a Visual Analytics process to guide domain experts in this task. For this purpose,
  we developed the TiMoVA prototype that implements this process based on user stories
  and iterative expert feedback on user experience. The prototype was evaluated by
  usage scenarios with an example dataset from epidemiology and interviews with two
  external domain experts in statistics. The insights from the experts' feedback and
  the usage scenarios show that TiMoVA is able to support domain experts in model
  selection tasks through interactive visual interfaces with short feedback cycles.
