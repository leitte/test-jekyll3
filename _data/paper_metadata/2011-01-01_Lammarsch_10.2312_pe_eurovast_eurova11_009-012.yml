abstract: The primary goal of Visual Analytics (VA) is the close intertwinedness of
  human reasoning and automated methods. An important task for this goal is formulating
  a description for such a VA process. We propose the design of a VA process description
  that uses the inherent structure contained in time-oriented data as a way to improve
  the integration of human reasoning. This structure can, for example, be seen in
  the calendar aspect of time being composed of smaller granularities, like years
  and seasons. Domain experts strongly consider this structure in their reasoning,
  so VA needs to consider it, too.
