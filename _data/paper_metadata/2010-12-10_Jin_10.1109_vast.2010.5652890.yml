abstract: Finding patterns in temporal data is an important data analysis task in
  many domains. Static visualizations can help users easily see certain instances
  of patterns, but are not specially designed to support systematic analysis tasks,
  such as finding all instances of a pattern automatically. VizPattern is an interactive
  visual query environment that uses a comic strip metaphor to enable users to easily
  and quickly define and locate complex temporal patterns. Evaluations provide evidence
  that VizPattern is applicable in many domains, and that it enables a wide variety
  of users to answer questions about temporal data faster and with fewer errors than
  existing state-of-the-art visual analysis systems.
