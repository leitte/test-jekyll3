abstract: 'In the first crowdsourced visualization experiment conducted exclusively
  on mobile phones, we compare approaches to visualizing ranges over time on small
  displays. People routinely consume such data via a mobile phone, from temperatures
  in weather forecasting apps to sleep and blood pressure readings in personal health
  apps. However, we lack guidance on how to effectively visualize ranges on small
  displays in the context of different value retrieval and comparison tasks, or with
  respect to different data characteristics such as periodicity, seasonality, or the
  cardinality of ranges. Central to our experiment is a comparison between two ways
  to lay out ranges: a more conventional linear layout strikes a balance between quantitative
  and chronological scale resolution, while a less conventional radial layout emphasizes
  the cyclicality of time and may prioritize discrimination between values at its
  periphery. With results from 87 crowd workers, we found that while participants
  completed tasks more quickly with linear layouts than with radial ones, there were
  few differences in terms of error rate between layout conditions. We also found
  that participants performed similarly with both layouts in tasks that involved comparing
  superimposed observed and average ranges.'
