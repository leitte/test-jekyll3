abstract: Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is one of the most versatile tools used for
  exploratory data mining. It allows a first glimpse of possible structure in the
  data, which can inform the choice of analyses used. Its uses are multiple. It can
  give the user an idea as to the clusterability or linear separability of the data.
  It can help spot outliers, or can hint at the intrinsic dimensionality of the data.
  Moreover, it can sometimes reveal unexpected latent dimensions in the data. With
  all these uses, MDS is increasingly used in areas as diverse as marketing, medicine,
  genetics, music and linguistics. One of the strengths of MDS is that it is essentially
  agnostic to data type, as we can use any distance measure to create the distance
  matrix, which is the only required input to the MDS algorithm. In spite of this
  generality, we make the following claim. MDS is not (well) defined for an increasingly
  important data type, time series subsequences. In this work we explain why this
  is the case, and we propose a scalable solution. We demonstrate the utility of our
  ideas on several diverse real-world datasets. At the core of our approach is a novel
  Minimum Description Length (MDL) subsequence extraction algorithm. Beyond MDS visualization,
  this subsequence extraction subroutine may be a useful tool in its own right.
