abstract: "The detection of frequently occurring patterns, also called motifs, in\
  \ data streams has been recognized as an important task. To find these motifs, we\
  \ use an advanced event encoding and pattern discovery algorithm. As a large time\
  \ series can contain hundreds of motifs, there is a need to support interactive\
  \ analysis and exploration. In addition, for certain applications, such as data\
  \ center resource management, service managers want to be able to predict the next\
  \ day\u2019s power consumption from the previous months\u2019 data. For this purpose,\
  \ we introduce four novel visual analytics methods: (i) motif layout \u2013 using\
  \ colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships\
  \ of motifs; (ii) motif distortion \u2013 enlarging or shrinking motifs for visualizing\
  \ them more clearly; (iii) motif merging \u2013 combining a number of identical\
  \ adjacent motif instances to simplify the display; and (iv) pattern preserving\
  \ prediction \u2013 using a pattern-preserving smoothing and prediction algorithm\
  \ to provide a reliable prediction for seasonal data. We have applied these methods\
  \ to three real-world datasets: data center chilling utilization, oil well production,\
  \ and system resource utilization. The results enable service managers to interactively\
  \ examine motifs and gain new insights into the recurring patterns to analyze system\
  \ operations. Using the above methods, we have also predicted both power consumption\
  \ and server utilization in data centers with an accuracy of 70\u201380%."
