abstract: 'We represent time-varying data as polyline charts very often. At the same
  time, we often need to observe hundreds or even thousands of time-varying values
  in one chart. However, it is often difficult to understand such large-scale time-varying
  if all the values are drawn in a single polyline chart. This paper presents a polyline-based
  3D time-varying data visualization technique. The technique places a set of polylines
  in the 3D space, where the X-axis denotes time, the Y-axis denotes values, and the
  polylines are arranged along the Z-axis. It provides two views: the first viewpoint
  has a view direction along Y-axis, and the second viewpoint has a view direction
  along Z-axis. The technique displays the overview of the data from the first viewpoint,
  and the detail of the specific parts of the data from the second viewpoint. It also
  detects frequent or outlier patterns by applying SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation),
  and indicates them so that users can discover such characteristic patterns. This
  paper shows several interesting visualization examples to demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the presented technique.'
