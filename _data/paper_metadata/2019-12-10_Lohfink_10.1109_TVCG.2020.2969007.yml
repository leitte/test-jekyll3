abstract: Operation technology networks, i.e. hard- and software used for monitoring
  and controlling physical/industrial processes, have been considered immune to cyber
  attacks for a long time. A recent increase of attacks in these networks proves this
  assumption wrong. Several technical constraints lead to approaches to detect attacks
  on industrial processes using available sensor data. This setting differs fundamentally
  from anomaly detection in IT-network traffic and requires new visualization approaches
  adapted to the common periodical behavior in OT-network data. We present a tailored
  visualization system that utilizes inherent features of measurements from industrial
  processes to full capacity to provide insight into the data and support triage analysis
  by laymen and experts. The novel combination of spiral plots with results from anomaly
  detection was implemented in an interactive system. The capabilities of our system
  are demonstrated using sensor and actuator data from a real-world water treatment
  process with introduced attacks. Exemplary analysis strategies are presented. Finally,
  we evaluate effectiveness and usability of our system and perform an expert evaluation.
