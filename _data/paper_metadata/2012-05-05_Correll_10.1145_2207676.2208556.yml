abstract: 'Visualizations often seek to aid viewers in assessing the big picture in
  the data, that is, to make judgments about aggregate properties of the data. In
  this paper, we present an empirical study of a representative aggregate judgment
  task: finding regions of maximum average in a series. We show how a theory of perceptual
  averaging suggests a visual design other than the typically-used line graph. We
  describe an experiment that assesses participants'' ability to estimate averages
  and make judgments based on these averages. The experiment confirms that this color
  encoding significantly outperforms the standard practice. The experiment also provides
  evidence for a perceptual averaging theory.'
